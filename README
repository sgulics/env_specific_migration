Allows you to create Rails migrations that will only run in the specified environments. This is useful when you are working locally on a system that may have very complex views. When you work locally you may want to create tables that looks like the views, while in QA or Production you will want to use the real views. 

You can do this 2 ways:

1. Extend EnvSpecificMigration::LocalOnlyMigration. This will only run in the test and development environments

class CreateAccountView < EnvSpecificMigration::LocalOnlyMigration

2. Use the run_migration_only_in method 

class CreateAccountView < ActiveRecord::Migration
   run_migration_only_in(:test, :development)
   .....
end
