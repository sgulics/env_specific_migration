Allows you to create Rails migrations that will only run in the specified environment

You can do this 2 ways:

1. Extend EnvSpecificMigration::LocalOnlyMigration. This will only run in the test and development test environments

class CreateAccount < EnvSpecificMigration::LocalOnlyMigration

2. Use the run_migration_only_in method 

class CreateAccounbt < ActiveRecord::Migration
   run_migration_only_in(:test, :development)
   .....
end
